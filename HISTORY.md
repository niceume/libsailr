# HISTORY

## Project Started [Aug 2018]

* I started this project to make it easier to manipulate dataset.
* First, I tried to make a simple calculator


## Milestone Ver 0.1 [Nov 2018]

* The program starts woring.
	+ Virtual stack machine is implemented.
	+ Arithmetic calculations are implemented. 
	+ How to compile & run

```
cd vm; ./compile_vm.sh; cd .. 
./compile.sh
./myparser sample_code/code1.slr
```

* Current plan. 
	+ Now I have struct_string structure to handle strings.
	+ But this project will be integrated with C++ projects.
	+ So C++ strings should be enabled to be manipulated.
		+ Now I am trying to implement it.
	+ Or support both situation by switching functions via macros.
